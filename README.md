# Significant-Star-Name-Display

This is a basic program that takes star data from a dataset, in this case being a .csv file, and plots them on a canvas based on their "significance". The names are plotted in random places to try, with basic overlap prevention being used (although it's not too effective) and the size is dictated by the star's apparent magnitude and its distance to us, contributing to how "significant" it is to us.
